# Perinuclearity
[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/180402561.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/180402561)

These are Python scripts that process input microscopy images to measure whether labelled organelles are closer 
to the cell's nucleus or closer to the cell's peripheral membrane

It was developed and used for a research project described in a paper "Targeted crystallization of mixed-charge 
nanoparticles in lysosomes induces selective death of cancer cells", *Nature Nanotechnology*, 2020. See this paper and the
corresponding Supplementary Information .pdf file (available from the Nature journal website) 
for description of how this "perinuclearity"
measure is defined.
The raw data used in that project is located in the ```/data``` folder and can be used as an example.

Main functionality is implemented in the ```perinuclearity.py``` script. Other  ```.py``` scripts are for processing the
data and plotting the figures for the abovementioned research article.
