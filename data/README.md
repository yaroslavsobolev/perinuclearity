Compressed data in ```.7z``` archived should be unzipped by "Extract Here" command. That is, the data files should end
up in locations such as ```/data/HT1080 8020/```

The ```overall_perivalues_npy_files.7z``` should be extracted 
such that the ```.npy``` files are in this ```/data``` folder. 
For example, at ```/data/MCF10A 8020 24h_overall_perivalues.npy```
